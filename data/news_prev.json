Schutt Sports, which makes the F7 Pro, claims that 35 percent of active NFL athletes have already adopted the helmet. Football is a sport with a traditionalist bent, particularly when it comes to this piece of gear. Case in point: one of Schutt's longtime users, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

      "summary": "This is what a Switch 2 looks like with a glossy glass protector attached to its screen. | Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge A glass screen protector is one of a few essential accessories that every Switch 2 owner should make, along with buying a protective case for the console. In fact, it should be a priority to stick one onto the console’s screen as soon as possible to avoid accidental scratches. I’ve been installing and removing Switch 2 screen protectors to test others on my console at an alarming rate, more than any sane person should, and here are the most important takeaways: Do not buy a flimsy plastic screen protector. They won’t protect your Switch 2 enough. It’s impossible to tell different brands’ protectors apart once they’re on your screen; product packaging and the installation process are the biggest differences (as well as the key factors that increase cost). Some protectors are glossy and some are anti-reflective, each with its own tradeoffs. For my money, glossy is the way to go. The matte finish looks good, but it reduces the screen’s vivid quality and its viewing angles. Of the options below, it’s easiest to recommend amFilm’s three-pack of glossy screen protectors. Not only is the pack incredibly affordable ($7.19 from Amazon), but the tray also allows for perfect alignment of the glass protector for easy, bubble-free installation. I’ve used this company’s screen protectors on various gadgets for years, and I particularly like its glossy option over the matte finish, since it lets the Switch 2’s screen fully shine through. amFilm three-pack of glossy screen protectors My go-to screen protector brand for years has been amFilm. Three glossy tempered glass sheets come in the box, and the tools make installation fairly simple. JSAUX’s model is just as good based on my testing, and just as affordable. Where to Buy: $8.65 $7.19 at Amazon amFilm OneTouch two-pack of glossy screen protectors In keeping up with some brands that offer faster installations, amFilm offers a two-pack of glossy protectors that includes a “OneTouch” tray. Remove the protector’s bottom film, attach the tray to your device, and then press gently on the protector until it’s fully applied. Where to Buy: $15.99 $8.99 at Amazon Dbrand Prism 2.0 two-pack of glossy screen protectors Dbrand’s Prism 2.0 includes two glass protectors for the Switch 2, each nestled into plastic cases that fit perfectly around the edges of the console (with the Joy-Con 2 removed). $34.99 is expensive for two protectors, but if simplicity and elegant packaging trump value, then this is a good option. Where to Buy: $34.95 at Dbrand Genki Aegis Shield two-pack of glossy screen protectors Genki offers a cheaper alternative to Dbrand with the Aegis Shield. It includes two protectors, and the installation process is nearly identical: just align the plastic frame with the console, pull the tab, and run your finger across the exposed section of the frame. Spigen makes a similar product that costs $24.99 for a two-pack. Where to Buy: $19.99 at Amazon $19.99 at Genki amFilm two-pack of matte screen protectors Let’s start with one of the most affordable options if you want to go the matte-textured route. AmFilm sells a two-pack of protectors at Amazon for $8.99. The set includes a plastic frame that serves as a guide to align the protector just right. JSAUX makes a similar product that’s the same price. Where to Buy: $12.99 $9.99 at Amazon amFilm OneTouch two-pack of matte screen protectors AmFilm also sells a two-pack with a OneTouch frame for easier installation. Again, keep in mind that opting for matte over glossy will reduce glare, but at the cost of viewing angles as well as the full vivid quality of the Switch 2’s screen. That’ll be an acceptable tradeoff for some, but not all people. Where to Buy: $15.99 $12.99 at Amazon Update, September 4th: Adjusted prices as needed, and added a link to recent coverage of a pre-production sample of Jsaux’s Obsidian AR screen protector."

You can see Barone’s name listed under the “Additional Character Voices” section of Silksong’s credits, which are accessible from the Extras section of the game’s title screen. I’ve also included a screenshot below: Cole Medeiros, head of operations and biz dev at ConcernedApe LLC, confirmed to The Verge that this is indeed the Eric Barone of Stardew Valley fame. However, Medeiros and Barone won’t reveal who Barone voices in Silksong; Barone would “rather not say which character(s) so as not to spoil any surprises for anyone,” Medeiros says. Stardew Valley and Silksong share another connection, too. Matthew Griffin, who handles marketing and PR for Silksong, once held a similar role for Stardew Valley, according to Silksong developer Team Cherry’s website."

      "summary": "Our picks include carrying cases and ones you can leave on during handheld and docked play. | Image: The Verge, Getty Images You might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since its June 2025 debut, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use. It didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below. I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both. As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost. The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play Dbrand Killswitch – Switch 2 Score: 8 ProsCons Very secure fit Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways) Clever dock adapter Chunky dock adapter Not the most affordable case Front protection only comes in the $80 tier Where to Buy: $59.99 at Dbrand The least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. Unfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality. The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover. When this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their release buttons. Basically, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue. Read my full review of the Dbrand Killswitch case for the Nintendo Switch 2 Runner-up JSAUX Split Protective Case Where to Buy: $29.99 $26.99 at Amazon $29.99 at Jsaux The Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside. I’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units). Lastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless. The best carrying cases for the Switch 2 tomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2 Where to Buy: $47.99 $30.99 at Amazon Tomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches. The FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side. Runners-up WaterField Designs CitySlicker case for Switch 2 Where to Buy: $129 at WaterField Designs WaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories — one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back. High-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather. The next opportunity to pre-order the case will be on September 11th at 11:00am ET. PowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2 Where to Buy: $19.99 at Amazon $19.99 at Best Buy Power A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. At just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this). This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 Where to Buy: $29.99 at Amazon $29.99 at Belkin For $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade. Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind. The best grip case for the Switch 2’s handheld mode The Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access. If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop. The $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock. Spigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2 Where to Buy: $39.99 $29.99 at Amazon $39.99 at Spigen Update, September 4th: Verified prices and stock for products mentioned in this post.

      "summary": "Darth Vader’s lightsaber is about to become someone’s prized possession. It’s up for auction alongside a bunch of other iconic movie props, as spotted earlier by The New York Times. The auction is hosted by the memorabilia company Propstore, and it estimates that Vader’s lightsaber will fetch anywhere from $1 million to $3 million. Darth Vader had this weapon in hand in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). As noted by Propstore, it’s made from a 1950s British camera flash bulb attachment, which prop makers modified with plastic grips, electrical wires, and magnification bubbles used in vintage calculators. In an interview with CBS News, Propstore CEO Brian Alinger said the lightsaber came from someone who received it as a gift while visiting the set of Star Wars as a child. Propstore matched the lightsaber to the Star Wars films “based on specific damage to the body.” There’s plenty of other exciting memorabilia up for grabs during the auction, with the whip used by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) expected to net $250,000 to $500,00, and Keaton’s Batsuit from the original Batman (1989), estimated at $250,000 to $500,000. You’ll also find a Spider-Man suit worn by Tobey Maguire, Wolverine’s claws from Logan (2017), a Neuralyzer used in Men in Black (1997), and Chris Evans’ Captain America shield from Age of Ultron (2015). You can browse the full catalog on Propstore’s website. The auction runs from September 4th to the 6th."

      "summary": "The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can pump out 5700 ISO lumens of brightness. | Image: Xgimi The new Horizon 20 lineup of 4K Google TV projectors from Xgimi targets gamers who want to play day and night on the biggest screen possible. In addition to promising an incredibly bright image from the flagship model, Xgimi is at IFA 2025 saying the entire lineup supports low-latency gaming with an input lag of just 1ms — that’s very responsive for a projector that will likely be able to produce a large image in rooms where you can’t control the ambient lighting. The Horizon 20 lineup — compromised of the base Horizon 20 model, the 20 Pro, and 20 Max — is built around an RGB triple laser architecture. The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can produce an astounding 5700 ISO lumens of brightness, according to Xgimi, which is “perfect for viewers who want immersive visuals even in daylight or high-ambient light environments.” That puts it just behind Dangbei’s 6200 ISO lumen claim for its S7 Ultra Max projector. The Horizon 20 Pro model can still produce a very respectable 4200 ISO lumens while the base model drops it down to 3100 ISO lumens, according to Xgimi. Chinese projector makers have gotten into trouble for misleading customers on brightness in the past, but that was before they started measuring brightness in ISO lumens — a legitimate measurement that often yields a number slightly smaller than tests conducted using the ANSI standard. 5,700 ISO lumens is so high that it’s in the range associated with projectors meant for large spaces that cost well over $10,000. Nevertheless, Xgimi tells me that it’s confident that reviewers and users will see this performance reflected in practice. Xgimi’s projectors also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and IMAX Enhanced modes, with the inclusion of optical zoom and lens shifting tech. Lens shift works by physically adjusting the position of the lens relative to the DMD chip, allowing the image to move up, down, left, or right without distorting or scaling it digitally. These projectors support a 240Hz refresh and VRR to match the output of a gaming console or PC. However, that 1ms response is only at 1080/240fps — lag increases to 2.2ms at 1080p/120Hz or 3ms at 4K/60Hz. Xgimi also claims a 10,000:1 contrast ratio when a dynamic black level enhancement mode is turned on. Netflix works out of the box which isn’t guaranteed with all-in-one projectors, and you get 24W of built-in Harman Kardon Speakers for 360-degree sound. The Horizon 20 lineup can be preordered in the UK and US starting on September 5th with shipments expected in October. Retail pricing will range between $1,699 for the base model and $2,999 for the Horizon 20 Max. However, temporary early bird pricing at launch drops that range down to $1,189 to $2,399, and you also get a floor stand and an Assassin’s Creed game code."

      "summary": "A shot of the HushJet Purifier Compact taken at IFA 2025. | Photo: Jennifer Tuohy / The Verge Dyson is launching a new air purifier that’s designed to look — but thankfully, not sound — like a jet engine. The Dyson HushJet Purifier Compact is launching in the US on September 30th for $349.99, featuring a new nozzle design that’s shaped to help the device blast jets of air at high speed, similar to how a concentrator works on a hairdryer. The increase in airflow velocity allows the HushJet Purifier Compact to provide “faster, more powerful purification,” according to Dyson. The nozzle is star-shaped to help reduce noise by dampening the sound waves from the compressor. The HushJet also features a night mode to prevent it from disturbing your sleep, in which it’ll operate at just 24 dBA, which Dyson says is “roughly equivalent to soft whispers.” The new Electrostatic HEPA filter can capture 99.97 percent of particles that are as small as 0.3 microns, according to Dyson, such as pollen, dust, and pet dander. Removing these from the air in homes could help alleviate sniffling and itchy eyes for anyone who suffers from being exposed to such allergens, but its worth noting that tech companies love to play on health-related concerns to sell their products. Dyson says its more energy efficient filter lasts up to five years — five times that of its previous HEPA filter — and is fully sealed to keep everything it sucks in inside. The HushJet Purifier Compact weighs seven pounds, measures 17.7 x 9 x 9 inches, and is suitable for rooms up to 203 square feet. It includes sensors that automatically monitor air quality in real time and adjust performance, but users can also create schedules for it to run at specific times, or connect it to Alexa or Google to manage the device using voice controls. Alongside the new HushJet, Dyson is also launching its new V16 Piston Animal cordless vacuum. It features a new dual conical cleaner head that adapts to all floor types, automatically speeding up when it senses carpet to give it a more robust clean and slowing down on delicate hard floors to avoid causing any damage. It’s also designed to pick up “even the longest hair,” according to Dyson, preventing hair from wrapping and tangling around the brush bar before sucking it directly into the bin. Pricing for the US hasn’t been revealed yet, but we’ll find out more when it launches there sometime in 2026."
